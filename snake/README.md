# Snake

A clone of snake.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to eat as many apples (red squares) as possible.
Each time an apple is consumed, the score goes up by one and the snake grows longer.
If the snake hits any of the edges of the game area or part of its own body, the game ends.

The snake is always moving forward.
To turn the snake's head to move in another direction use any of:

* Arrow keys.
* The WASD keys are Up/Left/Down/Right respectively.
* Touch screen: swipe in a direction.
